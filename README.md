# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
This Repo is my course project for Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning Data" 
It processes the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set from UCI

Dataset: [UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

run_analysis.R: R script that processes Dataset as described on Course Project page  
&nbsp;&nbsp;    1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;    2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;    3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;    4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;    5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
